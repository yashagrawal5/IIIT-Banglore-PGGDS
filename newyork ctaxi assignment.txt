--Title: The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission [TLC] Analysis
--Description : This assignment is based  on the concepts of Ingesting and Analyzing Big Data on the APACHE-HIVE platform.
--The dataset provided contains the detailed trip level data of trips made by taxis in New York City.
--Our analysis is focused on the yellow taxis for the months of November and December 2017.

#############################################
--Dataset Access: We can access the dataset using the below links:
--November Trip Data: /common_folder/nyc_taxi_data/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2017-11.csv
--December Trip Data: /common_folder/nyc_taxi_data /trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2017-12.csv

#############################################
--Methodology for Analysis: I would be conduct the analysis in 3 stages.
-- 1: Data Quality Verification and Exploratory Data Analysis
-- 2: Analysis Level-1
-- 3: Analysis Level-2

--Set the following parameters on our Hue Notebook:
--SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
--SET hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions = 10000;
--SET hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions.pernode = 10000;
--SET hive.execution.engine=mr;


--*************** Stage 1: Data Quality Verification and Exploratory Data Analysis ***************--

--we  will develop an intial data table titled taxifare_1. Then use this table to get a general understanding of the dataset.
--We will extract basic statistics from this taxifare_1 table and check for data validity and highlight any erroreous  values.
--We can analyze the statistics by considering that the table stores data in the following categories: 1.Trip Details and 2.Fare Details.
--Then create a neatly partioned and formatted data table to store the final data table orc_parted_taxifare to be used for Stage 2 and Stage 3 analysis.

--******** Basic Data quality Check : Question 2 ********--
--1.4 The data provided is for months November and December only. Check whether the data is consistent, and if not, identify the data quality issues. 
--Mention all data quality issues in comments.
--Since both tpep_pickup_timestamp and tpep_dropoff_timestamps are available we will set tpep_pickup_timestamp as our reference column as it is the first point of contact with passenger. Only trips that registered a tpep_pickup_timestamp and tpep_dropoff_timestamp during November and December 2017 will be considered.
--This implies that only trips that have been started and completed between November to December 2017 will be considered for our analysis.

select  year(tpep_pickup_timestamp)as Pickup_Year, month(tpep_pickup_timestamp)as Pickup_Month, count(*)as Num_Records
from taxifare_1

order by Pickup_Year, Pickup_Month;

--The pickup_timestamp results reveal several erroreous  records. The pickup_timestamps range from the year 2001 to 2041.
--Since our study is focussed only on the trip details of November and December of 2017.
 ---There are a 315 nonconforming records based on pickup_timestamp.

--1.5 In Query 1.4 we've checked the tpep_pickup_timestamp. Let us observe if there are any nonconformities in the tpep_dropoff_timestamp.

select year(tpep_dropoff_timestamp) as Dropoff_Year, month(tpep_dropoff_timestamp) as Dropoff_Month, count(*) as Num_Records

--The dropoff_timestamps results range from the year 2001 to 2041.
--There are a total of 1907 non-conforming records. 


--1.6 Let's check if there are any records in which the pickup_timestamp is after the dropoff_timestamp. This will clearly be a nonconformity as it is not logical.

SELECT count(*) as NonConf_timestamps
FROM taxifare_1
where unix_timestamp(tpep_pickup_timestamp) > unix_timestamp(tpep_dropoff_timestamp);

--The results reveal that there are 1419 records with pickup_timestamp after the dropoff_timestamp.
--Clearly, the dataset is not consistent and therefore we will indulge in a deeper EDA to identify data quality issues.
--These nonconforming records need to be removed before we proceed with furthur analysis.


--We can analyze the statistics by considering that the table stores data in the following categories: 1.Trip Details and 2.Fare Details.

from taxifare_1


--1. There are a total of 187,93,079 records in the dataset
--2. There are 2 TPEP vendors
--3. The tpep_pickup_timestamps and tpep_drop_timestamps range between 1st January 2001 to 15th November 2041. This is a nonconformity.
--4. The passenger count ranges between 0 to 192. Clearly this is a nonconformity as trip cannot be registered without passengers and 192 passengers is not Coherent.
--5. The trip distances range between 0 to 702.5 miles. A trip of 0 miles should not be charged and 702.5 miles seems like a outlier. However we will retain it. Average distance per trip is at 2.87 miles.
--6. There are 7 distinct rate_codes in the dataset when the data_dictionary limits it to 6. This is a nonconformity.
--7. There are 264 logged pickup_locations and 262 logged dropoff_locations.
--8. There are 4 distinct payment_type in the dataset



--1.8 EDA of components associated with Fare Details from taxifare_1

select min(fare_charge) as min_fare_charge, max(fare_charge) as max_fare_charge, avg(fare_charge) as average_fare_charge,

min(total_charge) as min_total_charge, max(total_charge) as max_total_charge, avg(total_charge) as average_total_charge
from taxifare_1;



--1. The fare_charge attribute Range: -$499 and $3,93,221.5 | Average: $13.04. The trips with fare_charges <= 0 will be treated as Nonconformities. The upperbound at $3,93,221.5 seems like an outlier but we will retain it with caution.
--2. The extra_charge attribute Range: -$48.64 and $69.8 | Average: $0.32. The extra_charge is a surcharge that can only take up $0.5 and $1 during rush hour and traffic, otherwise it is $0. Therefore, all other values will be treated as non-conformities.
--3. The mta_tax_charge attribute Range: -$0.5 and $117.85 | Average: $0.497. There are 19 distinct values of mta_tax_charge. The data dictionary specified that mta_tax_charge of $0.5 is triggered based on metered rate in use. Therefore, it can only take up two values $0 or $0.5 all other values will be treated as non-conformities.
--4. The tip_amount attribute Range: -$218 and $496 | Average: $1.85. Tip tip_amounts are automatically populated for credit card paid trips but cash tips are not recorded. However, a negative tip amount is peculiar [It might indicate a refund of trip or abnormality] therefore all records with tip amount<0 will be treated as non-conforming.
--5. The tolls_charge arribute Range: -$19 and $1018.95 | Average: $0.327. Negative toll charges seem peculiar and may indicate a refund transaction or abnormality. Therefore, all records with tolls_charge <0 will be treated as a non-conformity.
--6. The improvement_surcharge attribute Range: -$0.3 and $1 | Average: $0.299. The improvement_surcharge of $0.3 began being levied on assessed trips at flagdrop this means that the improvement_surcharge can only take up $0 or $0.3. The dataset has 5 distinct improvement_surcharges therefore we will treat all improvement_surcharge other than $0 and $0.3 as nonconformities.
--7. The total_charge attribute Range: -$499.3 and $3,93,222.32 | Average: $16.34. The negative total_charges may be logged due to refunds or disputed trips. This is an abnormality and will not be considered. Only records with total_charge >0 will be considered for our analysis. The upperbound total charge $3,93,222.32 represents an abnormality. It is caused due to the record with the fare charge as $3,93,221.5 . We will retain this record as we have no specified upper limit for the total_charge attribute.

--In our dataset it is clearly stated that tip_amount is not recorded for cash payments and is default set to 0.

--Here, since tip_amount is stored as double data type we have to use percentile_approx() instead of percentile(). From the documentation: percentile_approx(DOUBLE col, p [, B]) .Returns an approximate pth percentile of a numeric column (including floating point types) in the group. The B parameter controls approximation accuracy at the cost of memory. Higher values yield better approximations, and the default is 10,000. When the number of distinct values in col is smaller than B, this gives an exact percentile value.
--Since the number of distinct tip amounts 3,894<10,000 percentile_approx() returns the exact percentile value.

--There $0.683 difference of the Average_Tip - Median_Tip [50th percentile], this diffence constitutes to 39.50% of the inter-quartile range. Therefore, there is significant skewness in the distribution of the tip_amount parameter. This implies that the Average Tip is sqewed to the right of the Median_tip. This may be offset due to certain records having higher tip_amount values. Therefore, in this situation Average_Tip is not representative of central tendency. We can consider Median_Tip as a better representative of central tendency.

--3.1 What is the correlation between the number of passengers and tip paid? 
--Do multiple travellers pay more compared to solo travellers?

--Here we are trying to perform a correlation study between the tip_amount and number of passengers. Since this study will be directly impacted with the magnitude value of tip_amount and our dataset encodes tip_amount as $0 for all trips that are paid with Cash or with [payment_type=2] irrespective of the number of passengers.

-- Average Tip for Solo Trips: $2.659
-- Average Tip for Group Trips: $2.743

--our results of average tip are consistent with the obtained correlation value. Therefore there is a weak positive correlation betweem Passenger Count and Tip Amount, implying that passengers travelling in groups are likely to give a higher tip.

Therefore if a total objective view is required over the tip_amount wise bucketing of the table then we can specify a filter condition to remove all records where payment_type=2 as given below:

--select Tip_Bucket, count(*)as Num_Records, max(records_count)as Total_Number_Records,

--******** Analysis 2: Question 3 ********--

--3.3 Which month has a greater average ‘speed’ - November or December? Note that the variable ‘speed’ will have to be derived from other metrics.
--The Unix epoch (or Unix time or POSIX time or Unix timestamp) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds (in ISO 8601: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Literally speaking the epoch is Unix time 0 (midnight 1/1/1970), but 'epoch' is often used as a synonym for 'Unix time'. Many Unix systems store epoch dates as a signed 32-bit integer.
